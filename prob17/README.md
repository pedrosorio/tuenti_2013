Video.m:
*  Matlab code to read the video frames, extracts the red component of a pixel in the first blinking light. After imposing a threshold this corresponds to a binary sequence that can be converted to ascii. The output is a GET request with a cookie

get.py:
* Performs the get request with the cookie and displays the page, which gives the instructions: compute the sum of the digits in N! for the input N

prob17.py:
 -> solves the problem with simple python bignums, fast enough that factoring out 10's isn't needed
